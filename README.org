* Credits

This library wouldn't exist in its current form without the influence
of [[https://github.com/Raynes/tentacles/][Tentacles]], a client for the Github API by [[https://github.com/Raynes][Anthony Grimes]]. It borrows
shamelessly from =tentacles.core=, at least for the moment.

* TODO
  - [ ] Implement Tasks API
  - [ ] Moar stuff.
